# Machine-learning-classwork
This is my machine learning course materials with Professor [Hunter Johnson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hunter-johnson-5114488/) in fall 2022.
There is alot to this repo but **everything you should know is in [_GradedAssignments_](GradedAssignments) folder**. 

There you will see my work done(jupyter notebooks) for each assignment as well as my projects and exams. You will also find **grade.txt** in each work, where professor Johnson provided feedback for me.Except for assigment 1 where his grade is within my notebook.

Feel free to explore!

# Highlights
I would like to mention a few of my work.
