# Machine-learning-classwork
This is my machine learning course materials with Professor [Hunter Johnson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hunter-johnson-5114488/) in fall 2022.
This repo has a lot of work but **everything you should know is in [_GradedAssignments_](GradedAssignments) folder**. 

There you will see my work done(jupyter notebooks) for each assignment as well as my projects and exams. You will also find **grade.txt** in each work, where professor Johnson provided feedback for me. Except for assignment 1 where his grade is within my notebook.

Feel free to explore!

# Highlights
I would like to mention a few of my work.
### Poem classification ([project 2](GradedAssignments/Project2))
* analysed poems of 4 genres. Affection, environment, music and death
* built LSTM, bidirectional LSTM and CNN to predict poem genre
* found that these models performed poorly when trying to classify poem genres
### [Final exam](GradedAssignments/FinalExam) 
* created a simple neural net using tanh activation function from scratch
### data science salary EDA([project 1](GradedAssignments/Proj1)) 
* conducted EDA on data science salary
* used central limit theorem
* concluded that the dataset was not good enough for modelling due to lack of observations.

# My review of this class
Initially I did not like this class. Professor Johnson approach was more hands on where we had to create some models like adaline and logistic regression from scratch. I thought it was useless since
the sci-kit learn library exists where you can import these models. However I changed my mind as I had fun doing these exercises that were sometimes hard. In addition, my knowledge of the math used in these models deepened, like linear alegbra and calculus. Maybe this class would only be useful if I wanted to become a researcher but I still appreciate the in-depth look. 
However, who knows? This knowledge and experience may be useful later.
