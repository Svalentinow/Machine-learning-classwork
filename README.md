# Machine-learning-classwork
This is my machine learning course materials with Professor [Hunter Johnson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hunter-johnson-5114488/) in fall 2022.
There is alot to this repo but **everything you should know is in [_GradedAssignments_](GradedAssignments) folder**. 

There you will see my work done(jupyter notebooks) for each assignment as well as my projects and exams. You will also find **grade.txt** in each work, where professor Johnson provided feedback for me. Except for assigment 1 where his grade is within my notebook.

Feel free to explore!

# Highlights
I would like to mention a few of my work.
### Poem classification ([project 2](GradedAssignments/Project2))
* analysed poems of 4 genres. Affection, environment, music and death
* built LSTM, bidirectionanl LSTM and CNN to predict poem genre
* found that these models performed poorly when trying to classify poem genres
### [Final exam](GradedAssignments/FinalExam) 
* created a simple neural net using tanh activation function from scratch
### data science salary([project 1](GradedAssignments/Proj1)) 
* conducted EDA on data science salary
* used central limit theorem
* concluded that the dataset was not good enough for modelling due to lack of observations.
