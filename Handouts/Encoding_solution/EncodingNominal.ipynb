    "### Nominal Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Often datasets involve \"nominal\" or \"categorical\" features.\n",
    "\n",
    "These features do not have a natural numerical order. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in an economic dataset a person might be \"Employed\", \"Unemployed\", or \"Not in workforce\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Often data is categorical even when it is numerical. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example in an astronomy dataset a star might have a feature called \"type\" that has values in the set $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$.  But these types do not really have an ordering. Maybe it just refers to the \"metalicity\" or the chemical composition of the star. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type 1 and type 2 stars are not necessarily more similar than type 1 and type 4 stars. \n",
    "\n",
    "The labeling is arbitrary.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "You have probably noticed that all of the learning algorithms we have discussed assume that all features are numerical. \n",
    "\n",
    "Not only that, but many assume that the numerical columns have a meaningful ordering.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This assumption appears clearly in decision trees, for example, where we use inequalities on feature values to refine the data into different tree branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "The effectiveness of the linear methods we discussed as well as KNN uses an assumption of *continuity*. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that two features which are \"close\" have an increased likelihood of belonging to the same class. \n",
    "\n",
    "This learning bias (assumption of continuity) will not hold for data in which nominal data is transformed into arbitrary numerical codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cells below we will look at the `adult` dataset from the UCI ML Repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is not as exciting as it sounds.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It has many nominal features.  \n",
    "\n",
    "First we will experiment with a simplified version of the data to see the basic methods of nominal encoding, and then we will do industrial strength conversion of the dataset to fully numeric features. \n",
