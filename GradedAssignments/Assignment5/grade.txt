This is good work. 

You do not really exploit the similarities of the methods in your unified function, but at least it basically works. 

One section is headed "logit".  This function is the log of the odds ratio - it is not the same as logistic regression (just making sure that's clear). 

Your logistic regression code is right but I see the accuracy is low.

I think it has something to do with +-1 being the classes for Adaline and Perceptrion,
but 0,1 being the classes for logistic regression.
