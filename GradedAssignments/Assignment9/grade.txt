Hi Stephen,

Your explained variance ratio does add up to 1... I double checked.

sum(pca.explained_variance_ratio_)

has output 1.

To find the number of components for 90% variance explained you can does

pca = PCA(0.9)

or manually using np.cumsum(pca.explained_variance_ratio).

In your PCA plot you say

sns.scatterplot(data= df_pca,x = "principal component 1",y = "principal component 1")

but I think you mean

sns.scatterplot(data= df_pca,x = "principal component 1",y = "principal component 2")

I made the change and the plot came out right.

It's interesting -- there seem to be some really significant outliers.

For the silhouette method you should make a plot like this one for a range of k values and pick the one where the dashed line is closest to 1 when it hits the x-axis.

8/10
