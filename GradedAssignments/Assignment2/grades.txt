Nice work on feature scaling, except the last one.

I am not sure why you changed my print function -- it was written to make it clear whether scaling was working.

Notice that in your output the y axis is still 10 times bigger in scale than the x axis.  

All that has changed is that the picture looks nicer, which will not help with the ML issues.

The problem is that 

np.linalg.norm(X)

is a scalar.

You need to use

np.linalg.norm(X,axis=0)

In 1.6 approach 2 is blank?

Nice work on 1.8

9/10
